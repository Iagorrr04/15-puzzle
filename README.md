## About the game
The **15 puzzle** (also called **Gem Puzzle**, **Boss Puzzle**, **Game of Fifteen**, **Mystic Square** and 
many others) is a [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle "Sliding puzzle") having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.

Named for the number of tiles in the frame, the 15 puzzle may also be called a 16 puzzle, alluding to its total tile capacity. Similar names are used for different sized variants of the 15 puzzle, such as the **8 puzzle** that has 8 tiles in a 3Ã—3 frame.

The _n_ puzzle is a classical problem for modelling [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") involving [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science) "Heuristic (computer science)"). Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the [taxicab distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_distance "Taxicab distance") between each block and its position in the goal configuration.
